### Code Example

```c#
public static void Main()
{
	string path = "sample.dwg";
	CadDocument doc = DwgReader.Read(path, onNotification);
}

// Process a notification form the reader
private static void onNotification(object sender, NotificationEventArgs e)
{
	Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

WIP
---

The dwg/dxf readers are not yet fully implemented, the NotificationHandler will send a message to inform about the objects that could not be readed or any other error in the process.

### Dwg entities not implemented

- ACDBPLACEHOLDER
- VP_ENT_HDR
- POLYLINE_PFACE
- ACAD_PROXY_OBJECT
- MESH

### Dxf reader entities not implemented

- POLYLINE_PFACE
- ACAD_TABLE
- WIPEOUT
- LEADER
- 3DFACE
- MESH

### Dwg Writer 

ACadSharp has the first `DwgWriter` in an early alpha.

Compatible versions:

- **AC1014** - Release 14, 14.01 (LT97/LT98) - (WIP)
    - Produces a valid file but the entities are not in the model.
- **AC1015** - AutoCAD 2000/2000i/2002
    - This version depens on the implementation of VP_ENT_HDR to work properly with the different `Viewports`
- **AC1018** - AutoCAD 2004/2005/2006 (MOST STABLE - RECOMENDED)

#### Not implemented versions - Status

- **AC1021** - AutoCAD 2007/2008/2009
    - This is a particular and isolated version for DWG, it uses a different compression system and file distribution, due this difficulties, this version will not be implemented any time soon.
- **AC1024** - AutoCAD 2010/2011/2012
- **AC1027** - AutoCAD 2013/2014/2015/2016/2017
- **AC1032** - AutoCAD 2018/2019/2020
    - This versions have a similar structure than AC1018 but the file that is generated by the current writer seems to be missing something, they need further investigation.

The right now the writer only has capability to write **points and lines** in the `*Model_space` and it does not write all the information for the different objects in the document such as dictionaries, extended data or reactors.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** when you open a file writen by ACadSharp with Autocad the following message will appear: *The drawing file requires recovery* press on Recover and it will open the file normally.
This process this may cause a **loss of information on the file**.
