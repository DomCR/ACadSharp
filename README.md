### Code Example

```c#
public static void Main()
{
	string path = "sample.dwg";
	CadDocument doc = DwgReader.Read(path, onNotification);
}

// Process a notification form the reader
private static void onNotification(object sender, NotificationEventArgs e)
{
	Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```

WIP
---

The dwg/dxf readers are not yet fully implemented, the NotificationHandler will send a message to inform about the objects that could not be readed or any other error in the process.

### Dwg reader entities not implemented

- VP_ENT_HDR
- POLYLINE_PFACE
- ACAD_PROXY_OBJECT
- MESH

### Dxf reader entities not implemented

- POLYLINE_PFACE
- ACAD_TABLE
- WIPEOUT
- LEADER
- 3DFACE
- MESH

### Dwg Writer 

ACadSharp has the first `DwgWriter` in an early alpha.

Compatible versions:

- **AC1014** - Release 14, 14.01 (LT97/LT98) - (WIP)
    - Produces a valid file but the entities are not in the model.
- **AC1015** - AutoCAD 2000/2000i/2002
    - This version depens on the implementation of VP_ENT_HDR to work properly with the different `Viewports`
- **AC1018** - AutoCAD 2004/2005/2006 (MOST STABLE - RECOMENDED)

#### Not implemented versions - Status

- **AC1021** - AutoCAD 2007/2008/2009
    - This is a particular and isolated version for DWG, it uses a different compression system and file distribution, due this difficulties, this version will not be implemented any time soon.
- **AC1024** - AutoCAD 2010/2011/2012
- **AC1027** - AutoCAD 2013/2014/2015/2016/2017
- **AC1032** - AutoCAD 2018/2019/2020
    - This versions have a similar structure than AC1018 but the file that is generated by the current writer seems to be missing something, they need further investigation.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** when you open a file writen by ACadSharp with Autocad the following message will appear: *The drawing file requires recovery* press on Recover and it will open the file normally.
This process this may cause a **loss of information on the file**.
